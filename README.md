The server has Author, Book, and Review end points.
Users can create, read, update, and delete Authors, Books, and Reviews.

The Books have the foriegn key for their Author and Reviews have the foriegn key for their book.
The foriegn key is in the database, but there is no way to set that in the view. It might auto increment.

I followed this tutorial for ASP.NET:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app-mac/start-mvc

It showed me how to generate the controllers and views based on the models and how to set up the sqlite database.
